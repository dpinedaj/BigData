Hadoop Administration:
    -> Adding and removing nodes from the cluster:
        -> /etc/hosts on both master and child nodes should be updated prior to adding child nodes
        # TODO Check how to add or remove nodes using the CLI

    -> Verifying cluster health:
        -> hdfs dfsadmin -report

    -> Stopping/starting  components/services
        -> Stopping some can save resources
        # TODO Check how to do using the CLI

    -> Configuring Hadoop
        -> hadoop-env.sh
        -> core-site.xml
        -> hdfs-site.xml
        -> mapred-site.xml
        -> hadoop-metrics.properties
        -> log4j.properties

    -> Setting up rack topology
        -> Can be defined by script which specifies which node is on which rack
        -> Script is referenced in topology.script.file.name property in core-site.xml
        -> Example of property:
            <property>
                <name>topology.script.file.name</name>
                <value>/opt/ibm/biginsights/hadoop-conf/rack-aware.sh</value>
            <property>
        -> The topology script receives as arguments one or more IP addresses of nodes in the cluster.
            It Returns on stdout a list of rack names, one for each input.
            The input and output order must be consistent
