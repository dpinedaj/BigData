Pig and Hive:
    -> Both translate high-level languages into MapReduce
    -> Significant reductions in program size over Java
    -> All provide points of extension to cover gaps in functionality
    -> All provide interoperability with other languages
    -> None support random reads/writes or low-latency queries


Pig:
    -> Developed by Yahoo
    -> Can operate on complex, nested data structures
    -> Schema optional
    -> Relationally complete
    -> Turing complete when extended with Java UDFs

    Running Pig:
        -> Script:
            -> pig scriptfile.pig
        -> Grunt
            -> pig (to launch command line tool)
        -> Embedded
            -> Call in to Pig from Java
        -> Execution environments:
            -> local
            -> distributed
Hive
    -> Developed by Facebook
    -> Declarative language (SQL dialect)
    -> Schema non-optional but data can have many schemas
    -> Relationally complete
    -> Turing complete when extended with Java UDFs

    Running Hive:
        -> Hive Shell
            -> Interactive   -  hive
            -> Script        -  hive -f myscript
            -> Inline        -  hive -e 'SELECT * FROM mytable'
