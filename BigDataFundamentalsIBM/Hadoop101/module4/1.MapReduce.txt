MapReduce:
    -> MapReduce philosophy
        -> Map:
            -> Master node partitions the input into smaller sub-problems
            -> Distributes the sub-problems to the worker nodes
        -> Reduce:
            -> Master node then takes the answers to all the sub-problems
            -> Combines them in some way to get the output
