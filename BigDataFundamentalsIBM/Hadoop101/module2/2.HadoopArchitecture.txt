Hadoop 2.2 Architecture:

    -> Provides YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator):
        -> Referred to as MapReduce V2
        -> Resource manager and scheduler external to any framework
        -> DataNodes still exist
        -> JobTracker and TaskTrackers no longer exist

    -> YARN:
        -> Provide generic scheduling and resource management
            -> Support more than just MapReduce and more than just batch processing
        -> More efficient scheduling and workload management
            -> No more balancing between map slots and reduce slots

    -> New Architecture:
        -> In this setup there are now two NameNodes, one active and one standby
        -> Now there are JournalNodes. There must be al least three and there must be an odd number
            -> The JournalNodes decides which of the NameNodes is to be the active one and if the active NameNode has
                been lost and whatever the backup NameNode should take over
        -> Can be different NameNodes acting on different Namespaces, using the same DataNodes to store the data blocks


    -> Example of writting in HDFS:
        1. The client submits a "create" request to the NameNode
        2. The NameNode checks that the file does not already exist and the client has permissions to write the file.
        3. If 2 succeeds, the NameNode determines the DataNode to where the first block is to be written, if the client
            is running on a DataNode, it will try to place it there. Otherwise, it chooses DataNode at random.
        4. By Default data is replicated to two other places in the cluster. A pipeline is built between the three DataNodes
            that make up the pipeline, the second DataNode is a randomly chosen node on a rack other than of the first replica
            of the block, this is to increase redundancy
        5. The final replica is placed on a random node within the same rack as the second replica
        6. The data is piped from the second DataNode to the third, to ensure the write was successful before continuing.
        7. Acknowledgment packets are sent from the third DataNode to the second, from the second to the first and from the first
            to the client.
        8. This process occurs for each of the blocks that makes up the file.
        9. When the last piece is written, the NameNode checks that te blocks are at least minimally replicated before responding
