Why is everyone talking about Big Data:
    -> More data has been created in the past two years than in the entire previous history of human kind.
    -> By 2020, about 1.7 megabytes of new information will be created every second for every human beign in the world
    -> By 2020, the data we create and copy will reach around 35 zettabytes (7.9 zettabytes at 2015)

1 zettabyte = 1024 exabytes
1 exabyte = 1024 petabytes
1 petabyte = 1024 terabytes
1 terabyte = 1024 gigabytes


-> Cloud computing was a need to allows companies to process large data and complicated mathematical calculus over data

-> Major sources of Big Data:
    -> People-generated data
    -> Machine-generated data
    -> Business-generated data

-> Big Data skills include disconvering and analysing trends that occur in Big Data

-> Big Data comes in three forms:
    -> Structured, Unstructured and semi-structured
