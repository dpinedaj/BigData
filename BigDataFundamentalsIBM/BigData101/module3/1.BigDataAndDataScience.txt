Key Aspects of a Big Data Platform:
    -> Integration:
        -> Incorporate parts into a whole
    -> Visualization:
        -> Help the people to see the date with more simplicity
        -> An example is displaying a temperature map by region
    -> Analysis:
        -> A platform that takes in account how user is behaving on the website
            and bring up items that are based on a user's interest
    -> Workload Optimization:
        ->
    -> Security:
        -> Data privacy is very important to reject the attemps of access or collect of sensitive data
    -> Governance:
        -> Autometd Integration: Easy access to the data wherever it resides
        -> Visual content: that is, easy categorization, indexing and discovery withing big data to optimize its usage
        -> Agile Governance: Definition and execution of governance appropiate to the value of the data and its intended use

Applications:
    -> Hadoop
    -> Oozie
    -> Flume
    -> Hive
    -> HBase
    -> Apache Pig
    -> Apache Spark
    -> MapReduce and YARN
    -> Sqoop
    -> ZooKeeper
    -> Text analytics   

Data Science:
    -> Is the process of cleaning, mining and analyzing data to derive insights of value from it
    -> The data size is less important
    -> One can use data of all sizes, small, medium and big data, that is related to a business or scientific case
    -> Insights are extracted through a combination of exploratory data analysis and modeling.
