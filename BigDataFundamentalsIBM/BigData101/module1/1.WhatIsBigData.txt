"The basic idea behind the phrase 'Big Data' is that everything we do is increasingly
leaving a digital trace (or data), which we can use and analyze to become smarter 
The driving forces in this brave new world are access to ever-increasing volumes of data and our ever-increasing
technological capability to mine that data for commercial insights"

"Big Data is high-volume, high-velocity and/or high-variety information assets that demand cost-effective,
innovative forms of information processing that enable enhanced insights, decision making, and
process automation"

"Big Data refers to the dynamic, large and disparate volumes of data beign created by people, tools
and machines; it requires new, innovative and scalable technology to collect, host and analytically
process the vast amount of data gathered in order to derive real-time business insights that relate to consumers,
risk, profit, performance, productivity management and enhanced shareholder value"

"Big Data is a collection of data from traditional and digital sources inside and outside your company
that represents a source for ongoing discovery and analysis"



>> Velocity: Speed of the Data 
>> Volume: Scale of the data 
>> Variety: Diversity of the data
