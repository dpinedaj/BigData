High Value Big Data Use Cases:

    -> Big Data Exploration to improve business knowledge:
        -> The information usually is in different sections of the companies, big data will mine data from each one and
            centralize all the data in an unified view to extract value from it
        -> Example:
            -> Reducing Traffic Congestion:
                -> The data are from cammeras, weather, vehicles, the idea is to analyze streaming real-time data
                    gathered from the different sources, unify them and analyze
                -> Results: Enables ability to analyze and predict traffic faster and more accurately than ever before
                            Provides new insight into mechanism that affect a complex traffic system
                            Smarter, more efficient, and more environmentally friendly traffic

    -> Enhanced 360 degree view of the customer:
        -> Relationship between customer and organization is closets than ever, the Idea is to capture the Customer Information
            to improve engagement, revenue and loyalty
        -> Example:
            -> Prepare for Increased customer rush times
            -> Stock up customer preferences
            -> Plan for customer sprending habits (sales, coupons, product exposure)
            Results:
                -> Increased revenue
                -> Increased efficiency
                -> Build customer loyalty

    -> Security/Intelligence Extension to lower risk, detect frauds and monitor systems
        -> Avoid high-tech crimes, cyber-based terrorism, espionage, computer intrusions, fraud cases
        -> Improving Security:
            -> Analyze under-leveraged data:
                -> Emails
                -> Social media
                -> Search results
                -> Prepare for threats
            -> Results:
                -> Increased security
                -> Improved threat prediction
                -> Increase in customer confidence
                -> Deterrence of potential threats

    -> Operations Analysis, by results:
        -> Analyzing machine data, signals, sensors and logs
        -> This type of data is growing at an exponential rate and it comes in large volume and a variety of formats
        -> Using Complex analysis, and real-time analysis we can watch operations, customer experience, transactions and behavior
        -> Example:
            -> Aviation, improving security
            -> Collect and analyze massive amounts of data from plane's turbine, sensors and GPS
            -> Visualize data with complex big data analysis

            -> Results:
                -> Real-time visibility into operations of the plane
                -> Improved customer experience
                -> Increased efficiency of plane through optimization of fuel usage
                -> Real-time analysis for irregularities that may occur
