Replica:
		Physical data storage on a data node, there are usually several replicas with the same content on different data nodes

Block:
		Meta-Information storage on a name node, provides information about replica's location and their states

		>>Each block contains a generation state

	>>Block and Replica have their own states



####DATA REPLICA STATUS####

Finalized Replica:
		The content is frozen

		>>Preserves read consistency

Replica Being Written to (RBW):
		Is the state of the last block of an open file

		>>Different data nodes can return to use different set of bytes

		>>Data node and name node meta-information may not match during this state

		>>In case of failure, data node will try to preserve as many bytes as possible.

Replica Waiting to be Recovered (RWR):
		All Being written replicas after data node failure and recovery.

		>>RWR Replicas will not be in any data node pipeline and will not receive any new data packages.

Replica Under Recovery (RUR):
		Temporary status usually during client failure.



####DATA BLOCK STATES####

Under construction state:
		It's always the last block of a file, it's lenght and GS are mutable.

		>>Contains information of all RWR and RBW

Under Recovery State:
		When the replica go from RWB or RWR to RUR.

Commited State:
		When the replica go from RWB to FINALIZED state but not all of them

		>>commited block needs to keep track of RBW replicas

Complete State:
		All the replicas are in FINALIZED state.

####BLOCK RECOVERY####

>>Concurrency control, consistency guarantee
>>NameNode gets the list of DataNodes which contains the last block of a file. Then sends a primary DataNode and starts a bock recovery process.
